# VDI
Visual Display Interface (MRS Processing Library)

## What is VDI?
The Visual Display Interface (VDI) library is a set of open-source routines written in MATLAB for loading, preprocessing, visualizing, fitting and generally working with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data, particularly in-vivo. It was written to provide practitioners a modern, object-oriented framework which they could use from the command line within MATLAB. The main guiding principle of VDI is reproducibility, which it attempts to promote by focusing on modern, well-documented code; and extensive reporting and logging capabilities.

## Who is Responsible for VDI?
VDI originated in the laboratory of Assaf Tal, Ph.D., and features multiple contributers, mostly PhD and MSc students who have trained at the lab, who have contributed bits of code to its workings. Currently it is maintained by Assaf Tal.
